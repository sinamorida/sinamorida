- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sinamorida. Iâ€™m a mathematics student passionate about applying math to real-world problems, which led me to explore AI and data science. Recently, I became curious about blockchain and decided to expand my career in that direction. Now, Iâ€™d love to share some of my experiences with you.
